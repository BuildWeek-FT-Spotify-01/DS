# Spotify Recommender

We believe that people deserve unaquitted, fair access to any and all musical recommendations. Because of this belief, we created our app, **"Spotify Recommender"**. 

## How does it work?

Our application uses a KNN (k-nearest neighbors model), to create our suggestions to our users. Users need only input their favorite song title and the application will return the top 5 songs that have the highest correlation to the input song.

## What is required to run it?

This application takes advantage of Flask, SQLAlchemy, PostGreSQL, and Python. We have included a requirements.txt in our GitHub Repo that includes any dependancies that may be needed for this library. 

This project runs off the MIT license

## How to access it?

Our application is available via Heroku at the following link:

This application should require no additional items or downloads from the users.
